Administrative Error Review

: A review to determine whether the marking recorded in Marked Assessment Material contains an Administrative Error.

Marked Assessment Material

3.  a copy of any comments which the Assessor recorded during the marking of the evidence generated by the Learner.

2.  a failure to apply such criteria and procedures to the evidence generated by the Learner where that failure did not involve the exercise of academic judgment, or
